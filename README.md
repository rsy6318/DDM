## Installation

```
cd DDM
python set_up.py install
```

## Usage

Here we provide three versions of DDM, i.e., Point-to-Point, Mesh-to-Mesh, and Mesh-to-Point (in the paper, it is face).

###### Optimize a point cloud according to the reference point cloud

```
from Closest_Point_on_Surface import DDM_P2P

loss_func=DDM_P2P()

......
loss=loss_func(src_points,tgt_points)
......
```

###### Optimize a triangle mesh according to the reference triangle mesh

```
from Closest_Point_on_Surface import DDM_M2M

loss_func=DDM_M2M()

......
loss=loss_func(src_v,src_f,tgt_v,tgt_f)
......
```

###### Optimize a triangle mesh according to the reference point cloud

```
from Closest_Point_on_Surface import DDM_M2P

loss_func=DDM_M2P()

......
loss=loss_func(src_v,src_f,tgt_points)
......
```
